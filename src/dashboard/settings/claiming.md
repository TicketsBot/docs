# Claiming
***
***

Tickets can be claimed by a staff member, so other staff members cannot also reply to the ticket. The benefit of this is that tickets become less cluttered with many staff members talking at once.
Alternatively, an admin could claim a ticket to keep the support team from seeing potentially sensitive issues.

Note: Admins will always have access to any claimed ticket, as well as the user who claimed it.

# Claiming

Tickets can be claimed by your staff such that other staff members cannot also reply to the ticket. The benefit of this is that tickets become less cluttered with many staff members talking at once.
Alternatively, an admin could claim a ticket to keep the support team from seeing potentially sensitive issues.

Note: Admins will always have access to the ticket, as well as the user who claimed it.

- /claim Assigns you to a ticket
- /transfer @User Transfers a claimed ticket to another user
- /unclaim Removes the claim on the current ticket

Claiming can be configured in 3 ways:

- All staff members can see the ticket, but only the claimer can reply (Default)
- All staff members can see the ticket, and all staff members can reply
- Only the claimer can see the ticket

You can configure which methodology is used on the dashboard's settings tab:

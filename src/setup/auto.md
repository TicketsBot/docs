# Bot Configuration: Automatic Setup
***

Tickets provides an option to automatically create a basic configuration for you. This isn't recommended since the settings are unlikely to be to your preference, and a reaction panel is **not** automatically created. For information on creating reaction panels, see our guide [here](./panels.md).

To run the automatic setup mode, first ensure that you are either the owner of the server, or the owner has designated you as an administrator using `/addadmin @YourUsername`. Next, simply execute `/setup auto` in a channel the bot can see.

It will update you as the process progresses:

Simply assign your support staff the new `Tickets Support` role and your administrators the `Tickets Admin` role and your staff will be able to open and support users in tickets created via `/open` or the context menu (right click > apps > start ticket.)

You'll probably want to [create a reaction panel](./panels.md) so it's easier for your server members to open a ticket, or tweak the settings on the [web dashboard](./dashboard.md).

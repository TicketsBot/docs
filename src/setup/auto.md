# Bot Configuration: AUTO MODE
***
***

Tickets provides an option to automatically create a basic configuration for you. This isn't recommended since the settings are unlikely to be to your preference, and a reaction panel is not automatically created. For information on creating reaction panels, see our guide [here](./panels.md).

To run the automatic setup mode, first ensure that you are either the owner of the server, or the owner has designated you as an administrator using `/addadmin @YourUsername`. Next, simply execute `/setup auto` in a channel the bot can see.

It will update you as the process progresses:

Simply assign your support staff the new `Tickets Support` role and your administrators the `Tickets Admin` role and you're finished!

You'll probably want to [create a reaction panel](./panels.md) or tweak settings on the [web dashboard](./dashboard.md).

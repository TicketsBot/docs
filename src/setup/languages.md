# Language Customisation
***

Tickets is highly accessible, supporting over 30 languages at the time of writing.

Use the `/language` command and a embedded message with all supported languages will appear, select the language you want from one of the dropdowns below the message

![Language list](../img/languages.webp)

If you do not have a language selected, your server's preferred language will be used:

![Community language](../img/server_language.webp)

## Limitations
- The bot does not currently support server-level customisation of individual messages
- Some messages, such as embed titles and some button messages, are not currently translated

## Help Wanted
If you are multilingual and interested in helping translate the bot into more languages (or getting languages to 100%), please join our [support server](https://discord.gg/bh6aAfP) and let us know!
